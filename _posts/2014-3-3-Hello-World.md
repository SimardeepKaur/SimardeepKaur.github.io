title: Random Variables
---

Most people think of random variables as the normal variables which we are introduced in algebra class.But that is not what random variables are.

Lets take the most common and basic example used in a probability class, flipping of a coin.FLipping of a coin is a random process which can have two outcomes- Heads or Tails.Lets assume we have X as our random variable in this case.If I associate heads to 1 and 0 to tails, it means that I have mapped heads to 1 and tails to 0. But there is no hard and fast rule for 1 and 0.You can associate heads with 65 and tails with 79 or say whatever number you like.Still X will be a legitimate random variable.

Hence, random variables are means to map random outcomes to numbers.Technically, it is a way of quantifying the outcomes of random processes.It could be any random process like number of goals in a football game, temperatue of last 10 days in your city or the monthly profit of any company in a year.

You might have noticed that I have used capital X for a random variable, this is done deliberately because random numbers are generally assigned with capital letters unlike the variables you might be familiar from algebra class.

Now, the question is why are we using random variables.Why can't we simply write the outcome as heads or tails in the case if above mentioned examples. This is because not all the cases have just 2 outcomes.Consider the case of sum of upward faces of a die on rolling 2 dies together.This gives 36 outcomes.If we associate a random variable to it, it will be easy to denote various probabilities and you can use more mathematical notation on different outcomes.

Y is a random variable for sum of upward facing die on rolling 2 dies together.

Y= sum of upward faces of a die on rolling 2 dies together

To find the probability of sum of upward faces to be 14, it will be difficult to write P(sum of upward faces of a die on rolling 2 dies together = 14) 

Instead we can use P(Y=14).

In a nutshell, random variables make your life easier if solving probability questions is one of your hobbies or you just need to solve probabilities for various models in your upcoming Data Science project!
